== APPENDIX B  -  KEY
This legend is now included from TOT/manuals/key_legend.ref`.  Any key that is marked "legacy"
should only be used in the manual files listed in the comment.  The "legacy" keys are deprecated
and will be phased out.

Each define in the .ref file has a 5 field code to say what kind of define it is: i.e. /* RW--R */
The following legend shows accepted values for each of the 5 fields:

1. <<Read>>

2. <<Write>>

3. <<Internal State>>

4. <<Declaration/Size>>

5. <<Define Indicator>>

=== Read
* `<space>` = Other Information
* `-` = Field is part of a write-only register
* `C` = Value read is always the same, constant value line follows (`C`)
* `R` = Value is read

=== Write
* `<space>` = Other Information
* `-` = Must not be written (`D`), value ignored when written (`R`,`A`,`F`)
* `W` = Can be written

=== Internal State
* `<space>` = Other Information
* `-` = No internal state
* `X` = Internal state, initial value is unknown
* `I` = Internal state, initial value is known and follows <<Reset Signal>> `I`
* `E` = Internal state, initial value is known and follows <<Reset Signal>> `E`
* `B` = Internal state, initial value is known and follows <<Reset Signal>> `B`
* `C` = Internal state, initial value is known and follows <<Reset Signal>> `C`
* `V` = (legacy) Internal state, initialize at volatile reset
  (legacy: Only used in `internal_bundles.ref`)

* `D` = (legacy) Internal state, default initial value at object creation
  (legacy: Only used in `dev_ram.ref`)

* `C` = (legacy) Internal state, initial value at object creation
  (legacy:  Only used in `usr_2074.ref`)

* `C` = (legacy) Internal state, class-based initial value at object creation
  (legacy: Only used in `dev_ram.ref`)

=== Declaration/Size
* `<space>` = Other Information
* `-` = Does Not Apply
* `V` = Type is void
* `U` = Type is unsigned integer
* `S` = Type is signed integer
* `F` = Type is IEEE floating point
* `1` = Byte size (008)
* `2` = Short size (016)
* `3` = Three byte size (024)
* `4` = Word size (032)
* `8` = Double size (064)


=== Define Indicator
* `<space>` = Other Information
* `C` = Clear value
* `D` = Device
* `L` = Logical device.  Used by ness/nvm for manuals replication
* `M` = Memory
* `R` = Register
* `A` = Array of Registers
* `F` = Field
* `V` = Value
* `T` = Task
* `P` = Phantom Register

* `B` = (legacy) Bundle address
  (legacy: Only used in `gr_bundles.ref` and `internal_bundles.ref`)

* `G` = (legacy) General purpose configuration register
  (legacy: Only used in `dev_disp.ref`, `dev_mmu.ref`, `dev_pmu_vmacro.ref`,
  `dev_pwr_pmu_plus.ref`, `dev_ram.ref`, `dev_uvm.ref`, `usr_2074.ref`, `usr_motionsearch.ref`)

* `C` = (legacy) Class
  (legacy: Only used in `dev_ram.ref` and `usr_*.ref`)

=== Reset Signal

All graphics engine registers use the following defaults for reset signals:

* `E` = initialized with `engine_reset_`
* `I` = initialized with `context_reset_`
* `B` = initialized with `reset_IB_dly_`
* `C` = initialized with _???_

For units that differ from the graphics engine defaults, the reset signals should be defined here:

* none
