= Ref File Layout
Steve Glaser <sglaser@nvidia.com>
v0.2

This legend is now included from `TOT/manuals/key_legend.ref`.  Any key that is marked "legacy" should only be used in the manual files listed in the comment.  The "legacy" keys are deprecated and will be phased out.

Each `#define` in the `.ref` file has a 5 character code to say what kind of define it is (for example: `/* RW--R */`). The interpretation of each character depends on its position in the code.

The following legend shows accepted values for each of the 5 character positions:

[cols="1m,6"]
|===
| /1\..../ | <<Read>>
| /.2\.../ | <<Write>>
| /..3../  | <<InternalState>>
| /\...4./ | <<DeclarationSize>>
| /\....5/ | <<DefineIndicator>>
|===

== Read -- `/1.\.../`


[[Read]]
.Read
[cols="1m,6",options="header"]
|===
| Character | Meaning
|   `-`     | Field is part of a write-only register
|   `C`     | Value can be read and will always return the same, constant value line follows `C`
|   `R`     | Value can be read
|===

== Write -- `/.2.\.../`

[[Write]]
.Write
[cols="1m,6",options="header"]
|===
| Character | Meaning
| <space>   | Other Information
|   `-`     | If <<DefineIndicator>> is `D`: Field cannot be written. If <<DefineIndicator>> is `R`, `A`, or `F`: Writes to field are ignored.
|   `W`     | Can be written
|===


== Internal State -- `/..3../`

[[InternalState]]
.Internal State
[cols="1m,2,4,4m",options="header"]
|===
| Character | Internal State | Meaning | Legacy Usage
|  <space>  | No  | Other Information |
|    `-`    | No  | |

|    `I`    | Yes | Initial value is known and follows [ResetSignal] `I` |
|    `E`    | Yes | Initial value is known and follows [ResetSignal] `E` |
|    `B`    | Yes | Initial value is known and follows [ResetSignal] `B` |
|    `C`    | Yes | Initial value is known and follows [ResetSignal] `C` a| _(also see legacy use below)_
|    `C`    | Yes | Initial value at object creation | usr_2074.ref
|    `C`    | Yes | Class-based initial value at object creation | dev_ram.ref
|    `V`    | Yes | Initialize at volatile reset | internal_bundles.ref
|    `D`    | Yes | Default initial value at object creation | dev_ram.ref
|===


== Declaration/Size -- `/\...4./`

[[DeclarationSize]]
.Declaration/Size
[cols="1m,4",options="header"]
|===
| Character | Meaning
| <space>   | Other Information
|   `-`     | Does Not Apply
|   `V`     | Type is void
|   `U`     | Type is unsigned integer
|   `S`     | Type is signed integer
|   `F`     | Type is IEEE floating point
|   `1`     | Byte size (008)
|   `2`     | Short size (016)

|   `L`     | Logical device.  Used by ness/nvm for manuals replication |
|   `M`     | Memory |
|   `R`     | Register |
|   `A`     | Array of Registers |

== Reset Signal

=== Default Reset Signals for graphics engine

All graphics engine registers use the following defaults for reset signals:

[[ResetSignal]]
.Reset Signal
[cols="1m,6m",options="header"]
|===
| Character | Reset Signal
|    `E`    | engine_reset_
|    `I`    | context_reset_
|    `B`    | reset_IB_dly_
|    `C`    | ???
|===

=== Exceptions to default Reset Signals

For units that differ from the graphics engine defaults, the reset signals should be defined here:

* None
